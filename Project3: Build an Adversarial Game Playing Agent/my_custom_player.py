    The get_action() method is the only required method for this project.
    You can modify the interface for get_action by adding named parameters
    with default values, but the function MUST remain compatible with the
    default interface.

    NOTES:
    - The test cases will NOT be run on a machine with GPU access, nor be
      suitable for using any other machine learning techniques.

    - You can pass state forward to your agent on the next turn by assigning
      any pickleable object to the self.context attribute.
